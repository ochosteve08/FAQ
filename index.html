            <div class="question">What is Lorem Ipsum?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard
                dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen
                book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
                unchanged.

            <div class="question">Where does it come from?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature
                from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia,
                looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of
                the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.

            <div class="question">Why do we use it?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at
                its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as
                opposed to using'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. </div>
